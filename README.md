The Music_theory.py program is going to be include scales, chords, and games. 
The scales portion will include major/minor/blues scales and maybe modes later on. 
The chords portion will include formulas for chords and the chords written out such as triads, sevenths, and extended chords. 
The games portion will have  a couple games like spell that chord (it will give you a chord name and you have to type in the 
notes of the chord. It's counterpart name that chord will also be included (it spells out a chord and the user has to guess the chord name).
Another game will be the spell the scale quiz in which the program gives a scale name and key and the user has
to type in the notes. It's counterpart guess the quiz will also be included.
I hope to implement a difficulty level at some point.

The game.py program is going to be a turn based battle game in which you can name your characters and battle it out with computer
generated characters. If I can get that far I will probably implement some other features but first the basics.
